# ina-covid-bed

**This project is no longer maintained and has been made publicly accessible in an archived state.**

In the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, I stumbled upon a way to scrape bed availability data from a government website and decided to share my findings on Twitter. My tweet quickly gained traction, receiving many retweets and likes.

One of the people who saw my tweet was [@masbagal](https://github.com/masbagal), who was inspired to create a web app that would make this information more easily accessible to the public. [@yogiw](https://github.com/yogiw) joined the project and added a map page to the web app, while [@pveyes](https://github.com/pveyes) implemented geolocation support.

[@irsyaadbp](https://github.com/irsyaadbp) stepped in and purchased the domain bed.ina-covid.com, which was then assigned to the web app. [@galihlprakoso](https://github.com/galihlprakoso) helped us to make the site more discoverable with the best SEO.

As more and more collaborators joined the project, new ideas and bug fixes were implemented, and the project eventually evolved into a real API endpoint that served not just to supply the information to users but also as an example for those learning to code.

Thanks to the help from [@memetj\_](https://twitter.com/memetj_), the project eventually reached the hands of influencers like [@jejouw](https://www.instagram.com/jejouw/?hl=en) and started to gain even more visibility.

As the number of COVID-19 cases began to decline in 2022, many hospitals began to have more available beds, and the project started to become less relevant. Now in 2023, the project has been archived, but it will always be available for others to see, learn from, and build upon in the future.

I am grateful to everyone who contributed to this project and helped to make it a success. Thank you!
